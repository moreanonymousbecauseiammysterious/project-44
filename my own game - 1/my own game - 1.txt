stop the aliens, but that they only created one, and it would take
another 10 years to find the resources to create another, since this
one also took so long to cretae. Jason finds himself about to sneeze,
and can't hold it in, and is soon discovered by a guard, and sent to
the government for his punishment, but Jason isn't someone who will
go down without a fight. he soon finds himself in front of the
president, and shows just how good a fighter he really is. the

7. how do I plan to make my game engaging:
I plan to make my game engaging by using aliens attacking earth,
and having the player use Jason to fend them off. if Jason fails
to do so, the game will come to an end. he techically cannot succeed,
because it will go infinitely. he must shoot the aliens with his
special vaporizing gun.
